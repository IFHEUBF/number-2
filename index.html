            or to play with your heart, i'm not bored either,
             and its not to lift my ego infront of my friends or to show off,
              i'm not with you cause i cant get anyone, or to have  someone to text everyday.
              i want you because, youre so fucking amazing, you're literally perfect in my eyes.

                 cause you're the best thing that's happened to me
                  and 
                  i dont want to lose you (so stay forever)

                     i love your smile, i love when u look at me with those puppy eyes,
                      I love your short and wavy hair , I love the way we just laugh randomly on call and esp when u stare at eachother,
                       i love when u make me laugh, i love how u find comfort with me and you trust  me,
                        i love how random you are especially on call you start singing randomly or meowing. 
                        I love that no matter what i've put you through you never gave up on US on me. 
                        I love being with you, i love that youre still here even though you've been thru so much,
